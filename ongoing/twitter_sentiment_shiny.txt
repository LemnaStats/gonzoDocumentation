I want to create a shiny app for my past project on twitter sentiment. There are some caveats:

* I have never made a shiny app before
* I don't know how to do this

The reason I want to do it with Shiny is because the original functions were written in R. I feel like that's the most natural way to do it, or it 
has to be. Not sure though.

How am I going to go about this?

1. Plan the site visually
2. Review the scripts I currently
3. Make the site according to the plan

I am also going to use Github this time around! It'll make it easier for me to review my code.

First, let's upload what I currently have to a github repository.

https://github.com/LemnaStats/TwitterSentiment

Done!

Now let's design the site. I'm looking to take the following information:

* A list of queries the searches
* A list of filtered words

And spit out:

* A bar graph of the sentiment rating for each search
